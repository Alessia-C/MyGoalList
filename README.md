# MyGoalList

## Description

"MyGoalList" is a project created to learn and improve knowledge of **TypeScript** and **React**. It is an application that allows users to add, view, and remove goals from a list. The goals data is saved in `localStorage` to ensure persistence even after the application is closed and reopened.

This project was developed as a study exercise to explore the fundamentals of TypeScript and to enhance skills in building React applications with TypeScript.

## Features

- **Add new goals**: Users can enter a title and a description for a new goal.
- **View goals list**: Added goals are displayed in a list format.
- **Delete goals**: Users can remove a goal from the list.
- **Data persistence**: Goals are stored in the browser's `localStorage`, so they remain available after reloading the page.

## Technologies Used

- **React**: For building the user interface.
- **TypeScript**: To add static typing and improve code reliability.
- **CSS**: For styling the application.
- **LocalStorage**: To persistently save goals in the browser.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
